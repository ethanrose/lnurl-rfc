LUD-21: Pay in local unit of account
====================================

`author: ethanrose`

---

The idea here is to enable a merchant to receive an exact payment amount, in whatever currency their goods are priced in (i.e. their own fiat currency). A sender should be able to input the amount in the recipient's own unit of account. This is required for static (think printed) QR codes with no predefined amount when the buyer himself is going to input the amount manually.

## Description of the payment flow

For example, a merchant is pricing their goods in a made-up currency, let's call it "USD". This may or may not have any relationship with the actual United States Dollar, the name is just illustrative. The merchant has a static QR code on his stall that customers can scan. The flow goes like this:

1. Customer picks up a good they want to buy;
2. Merchant shows them the QR code, they scan it;
3. The merchant's LNURL-Pay server (say, at "https://merchant.example.com") returns a response that contains a "multiplier" for units in the "USD" currency to be turned into millisatoshis, along with a cosmetic name for the currency (in this case, "USD") _(see section 1 below)_;
4. The customer sees a screen on their Lightning wallet that says something like: `The vendor 'merchant.example.com' expects an amount in its own currency, "USD"` and then it has an input field for the amount to be typed in, then a clear depiction of the multiplier (suppose it's `3520000` for "USD") and the result in satoshis: `______ × 3520.000 = ______ satoshis`;
5. Merchant tells customer the price of the chosen good (let's say it's `2` "USD");
6. Customer types the amount and sees `2 × 3520.000 = 7040 satoshis`, presses ok;
7. Wallet calls the merchant's LNURL-Pay server with the amount in millisatoshis along with the amount in the merchant's currency and the merchant's currency name _(see section 2 below)_;
8. The merchant's LNURL-Pay server validates the request using its internal multipler and returns the Lightning invoice as in LUD-06, _with the same amount specified in the amount query parameter_, or an error if the multiplier used by the wallet is invalid or wrong somehow.
9. Wallet checks the amount, as in LUD-06, and proceeds.

## 1. `currency` record in payRequest details

If `SERVICE` wishes for a `WALLET` user to specify a payment amount in a different unit of account, it MUST alter its JSON response in the payRequest details response to include a `currency` object, as follows:

```diff
 {
   "callback": String,
   "maxSendable": number,
   "minSendable": number,
   "metadata": string,
+  "currency": {
+    "name": "USD",
+    "minSendable": 1,
+    "maxSendable": 50000,
+    "multiplier": 64501 // estimated millisats per "unit"
+  },
   "tag": "payRequest",
 }
```

## 2. Including `currency` in callback parameters

In the next step of the LNURL-Pay flow, `WALLET` must include a `currencyAmount` and `currencyName` query parameters in the callback along with the `amount`:

```diff
- <callback><?|&>amount=<milliSatoshi>
+ <callback><?|&>amount=<millisatoshi>&currencyAmount=<amountInMerchantCurrency>&currencyName=USD
```
